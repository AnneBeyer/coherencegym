Model

"DialoGPT-medium" extends gpt-2-medium by fine tuning on Reddit data in order to model dialogue.
For this, the eos token is re-defined to mark a speaker change (represented by the [SEP] token in the input).

    abstract = "We present a large, tunable neural conversational response generation model, DIALOGPT (dialogue generative pre-trained transformer). Trained on 147M conversation-like exchanges extracted from Reddit comment chains over a period spanning from 2005 through 2017, DialoGPT extends the Hugging Face PyTorch transformer to attain a performance close to human both in terms of automatic and human evaluation in single-turn dialogue settings. We show that conversational systems that leverage DialoGPT generate more relevant, contentful and context-consistent responses than strong baseline systems. The pre-trained model and training pipeline are publicly released to facilitate research into neural response generation and the development of more intelligent open-domain dialogue systems.",

Training

    What corpus was this model trained on? 147M conversation-like exchanges extracted from Reddit comment chains over a period spanning from 2005 through 2017, in total 1.8 billion words, vocabulary of 50,257 (see Zhang et al. for details)
    extends the Hugging Face PyTorch transformer with additional Mutual Information Maximization objective

    If possible, provide some standard performance measures (e.g. test perplexity) and complexity measures (e.g. parameter count, number of layers, etc.).
    Parameters: 345M, Layers: 24, Embedding size: 1024, Batch size: 64
    See Tables 2 & 3 in Zhang et al. (2020) for performance measures
